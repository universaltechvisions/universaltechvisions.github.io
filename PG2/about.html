<h2>Our values</h2>
<h5>"We hold one universal constant in our philosophy: consumer first." -Evan Joseph McAfee</h5>
<p>It's true. In all sectors of our business, we strive to put you the consumer at the forefront of our goals. This means that you will never catch us doing anything detrimental to the consumer for our benefit. Of course, we rely on you to hold us to it. This is not your usual mission statement, and we arent your usual company. This is not going to be a long, drawn out dissertation about how we care, this page is here to show you.</p>
<h6>Cookies and Data collection</h6>
<p>We do not collect any data that you do not directly and knowningly consent to. There is exactly one cookie that this site uses and that is for logging in to your account. We believe that a sale begins when you decide you want something, not when you see it. We also will not use targeted ads. Our customers are people with minds, not mindless animals who see and act on impulse.</p>
<h6>Right to repair</h6>
<p>It is our belief that it is not our place to demand that we be the ones to fix our products when they break. With every product we sell, we believe that it is our duty to provide documentation so extensive, that any small business anywhere may fix it independently. This also means that we will not create artificial barriers to fixing these products either, such as requiring OEM parts. We like it when you visit, but we arent going to twist your arm.</p>
